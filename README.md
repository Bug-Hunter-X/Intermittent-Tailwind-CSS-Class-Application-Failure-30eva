# Intermittent Tailwind CSS Class Application Failure

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug encountered with Tailwind CSS where classes fail to apply or produce unexpected styles. The issue is characterized by its intermittent nature and difficulty in consistent reproduction. The primary scenario involves dynamic class names or conditional class rendering.  Solutions to potential causes are explored.

## Bug Description

The core problem is that Tailwind CSS classes don't always render as expected. Styles might be missing, incorrect, or inconsistently applied across different render cycles. This often manifests when dynamic class names or conditional rendering is involved.  Debugging is complicated by the erratic behavior of the error.
